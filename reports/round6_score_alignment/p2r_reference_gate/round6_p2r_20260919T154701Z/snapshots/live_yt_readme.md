## LIVE-YT-VideoCropping
The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://utexas.app.box.com/s/hylumfu8akjhdgdd4teynsyc6ickwv1j/folder/407721578256). The **'LIVE-YT-VC'** folder has -
1. **study_videos** - 1800 videos sampled from LSVQ and YT-UGC, which we use to collect bounding box labels. From each video, we sample 30 frames, and each frame is labeled by a human subject.
 
2. **video_bbox_labels.csv** - The csv file contains the bounding box labels for each video in the dataset.
   Column descriptions:

  - <em>video</em> - name of the video file.
  - <em>num_scenes</em> - number of scenes detected in the video using PySceneDetect
  - <em>frameN</em> - bounding box labels in a dictionary containing four coordinates. Here 'N' is the frame index.
